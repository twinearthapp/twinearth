#TwinEarth White Paper v1.8
##*A digital twin of Earth, where time belongs to the user, and the trace remains forever - with complete freedom of choice: through Google or completely anonymously*

> **Slogan:**
> **“Join the journey.
> You are not a guest. You are part of the planet.”**

## 1. Introduction

TwinEarth is a digital twin of Earth, built on the Solana blockchain. The project allows users to:

- Travel the planet at any pace - from instant movement to endless contemplation.
- Receive unique NFTs and $EARTH tokens for activity - **without immediate payment of commissions or gas**.
- Interact with other participants in real time.
- Use the platform **through any web browser — with complete freedom of choice of login: through Google (for convenience) or directly through a crypto wallet (for anonymity and decentralization)**.

> **Google is an option, not a requirement.**
> For those who want easy login — it is available.
> For those who value privacy and autonomy — **completely anonymous access through the Solana wallet** is provided.

**Key technological feature:**
Tokens and NFTs are credited to the user **in their account space (off-chain)** and can be withdrawn to the wallet later — **at the user's choice**. This minimizes fees, lowers the entry barrier and makes the experience as smooth as possible — **regardless of the login method**.

The project is developed and managed by a single initiator. At the first stage, the priority is to focus on the product, not on partnerships or external integrations.

## 2. The Problem

Modern digital environments:

- Separate humans from nature, offering abstract, accelerated experiences.
- Require disclosure of identity even where it is not necessary.
- Focus on data collection, not on meaningful participation.
- Do not respect the user's choice: to be anonymous or identified.

TwinEarth offers an alternative - a digital space where you can:

- Explore the Earth without an ecological footprint.
- Grow through movement, observation and interaction.
- Participate in the economy without paying for each action.
- **Choose: to log in with identification (Google) - or completely anonymously (through a wallet)**.
- Create eternal artifacts - NFTs, secured in an immutable storage.

---

## 3. Solution

TwinEarth is a web platform accessible via a browser where:

- The user chooses the route and pace - from a 60-second round-the-world trip to a slow, endless journey.
- Every action is recorded: stops, routes, joint sessions - everything can be turned into NFT.
- Group travel allows you to meet others, communicate, synchronize the path.
- Route broadcasts allow you to share experiences and receive NFT memories as a spectator.
- The $EARTH (SPL) token is used for rewards, staking and governance via DAO in the next stages.

### 🔐 Two ways to enter - the same rights

#### A. Via Google (for convenience)
- An account is created + an automatic wallet “under the hood”.
- Suitable for beginners, educational groups, mass entry.
- Recovery - via email.
- All assets (tokens, NFTs) are stored off-chain until withdrawal.

#### B. Via a crypto wallet (for anonymity and decentralization)
- Connection via Phantom, Backpack, Slope, etc. (Wallet Adapter).
- **No link to email, Google, KYC.**
- Complete anonymity. Complete control.
- All assets (tokens, NFTs) are also stored off-chain until withdrawal → **same UX for everyone**.

> **Important:**
> The user **owns their assets from the moment of accrual** — regardless of the login method.
> Rights are recorded in the system. Withdrawal to the wallet is optional.
> **Anonymity ≠ limited rights.** On the contrary — in TwinEarth, an anonymous user has the same capabilities as an identified one.

## 4. Key functions (MVP)

### Endless travels

- Select a route along the real geography of the Earth.
- Speed ​​control: instant, normal, slow, infinite.
- Ability to stop at any point — with access to sounds, facts, visual content.

### Collective routes

- Create joint journeys with other users.
- Synchronize movement, voice and text chat.
- Joint contemplation — stops by agreement of the group.

### Live Journeys

- Broadcast your route in real time.
- Viewers can join, ask a question, get an NFT memory.
- Archive broadcasts in the “TwinEarth Chronicles”.

### Economy and NFT

- $EARTH (SPL) token — a reward for activity, access to functions, future management.
- Three basic NFT collections:
1. **“The Path of the Contemplator”** — for completed routes with notes.
2. **“The Voice of the Earth”** — for audio/text recordings created at stopping points.
3. **“The Endless Trail”** — for continuous travels (from 24 hours).

> All NFTs are stored on Arweave. Authors receive 10% royalties from secondary sales. 2% is automatically sent to the project development fund.
> The user **owns the NFT from the moment of receipt** — the rights are recorded in the account. Withdrawal to the wallet is optional.
> **Works the same way — for both Google accounts and anonymous wallets.**

## 5. Technological basis

- **Blockchain:** Solana (Proof of History — verifiable, immutable sequence of events in time)
- **Token:** $EARTH (SPL)
- **NFT:** Metaplex (Programmable NFT)
- **Login methods:**
- Google OAuth → automatic wallet (for mass access)
- Wallet Adapter (Phantom, Backpack, etc.) → complete anonymity (for Web3 users)
- **Off-chain economy:**
- All accruals (tokens, NFT) are stored in the encrypted account space.
- The user sees the balance, history, collections in the interface.
- Withdrawal to wallet - on request → one transaction → minimization of fees.
- Rights to assets are fixed at the moment of accrual → user - owner, even before on-chain recording.
- **Storage:** Arweave (NFT data), IPFS (media)
- **Frontend:** React, Solana Web3.js
- **Server:** Node.js, Express
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth 2.0 + Solana Wallet Adapter
- **Multiplayer:** Socket.io
- **Geodata:** CesiumJS, OpenStreetMap
- **Security:** AES-256 key encryption, account binding (for Google), complete anonymity (for wallets)

> **Proof of History in the product philosophy:**
> Like Solana, where time is not an abstraction but a provable sequence, in TwinEarth **time belongs to the user**.
> You choose the pace. You choose the moment of withdrawal. You choose what to leave behind forever - **and you choose whether to reveal your identity or remain anonymous**.
> And every choice you make is recorded. Unchangeable. Forever.

## 11. Philosophy

TwinEarth is not entertainment or a metaverse. It is a digital space where:

- **Time is not an abstraction, but a measurable, verifiable value.**
As in the Solana architecture with its Proof of History, here time is not linearly imposed by the system — it is **structured, recorded and belongs to the user**.
You choose: a moment or eternity. A second or a century of travel. And each of your choices is recorded, confirmed, unchangeable.

- **Every action leaves a trace.**
Not a temporary like, not an erasable post — but an NFT, secured in an eternal storage. Your route, your pause, your voice — become part of the planet's memory.

- **Technology serves man, and not the other way around.**
No seed phrases if you don't want them. No gas fees for each action.
**If you want, log in via Google. If you want, stay anonymous via your wallet.**
You choose — and the system respects your choice.

- **The Earth is perceived as a living system, not as a background for content.**
Here you do not “consume species” — you **resonate** with the landscape, culture, time.

TwinEarth is built on a technology where **history is provable (Proof of History)**, which means your presence in it is too.
You are not a guest. You are a participant.
You do not pass by. You leave a trace.
And this trace is not ephemeral. It is recorded. Forever.
**With or without your name. At your choice.**

---

## 12. Conclusion

TwinEarth is the first step towards a new digital ethics: quiet, conscious, eternal.
A platform where you can simply be — with yourself, with others, with the planet — **with complete freedom of choice: to be recognizable or to remain a shadow.**

Development has begun.

The first stage — 6 months.

The goal is to prove: technology can return, not take away — **and respect, not impose**.

**Slogan:**
> **“Join the journey.
> TwinEarth does not wait for owners.
> It waits for those who are ready to be a part — with or without a name.”**
