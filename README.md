## Hi, I'm Vitaly Pozderin— the creator of TwinEarth

"We are not building a metaverse. We're getting the connection back."

I am creating **TwinEarth**— a digital twin of Earth, where:
- Time is controlled by you
- Running = traveling
- NFT = footprint in the planet's memory
- $EARTH = participation, not ownership
* **Currently in development:**
- White Paper v1.0 — done
- MVP "Machu Picchu" - in progress 🚧
- Solana Grant Application - in preparation 📄

# 🌍 TwinEarth Sanctum — Where the Digital Sanctifies the Real. On Solana.

> “You are not a guest here. You are a part of the planet.”

TwinEarth is not a product. It is a **holy space** where:
- Your curiosity becomes an NFT
- Your voice will be remembered by the planet
- Your discovery will bring $EARTH
- Your participation will change the interface

This is a **movement, not a startup**. 
And it is born **with your participation**.

## 🕊️ Sanctum Philosophy

> TwinEarth is a bridge. 
> Between your screen and the real planet. 
> Between your question and the eternal artifact. 
> Between your voice and the voice of the earth. 
> 
> We don't build it according to a plan. 
> We build it according to your feedback.

We don't collect metrics. 
We collect **your desires**:

→ Which artifacts are needed? 
→ Which interface is convenient?

** Your answer will become a code.**

# 🌍 TwinEarth — Digital Twin of Earth on Solana  
## *Where time is yours. Identity is your choice. The planet remembers you.*

> **“You are not a guest here. You are a part of the planet.”**

## 👋 Hi, I’m Vitaly Pozderin — creator of TwinEarth

> **“We are not building a metaverse. We are getting the connection back.”**

I’m building **TwinEarth** — a living digital twin of Earth on Solana, where:

- ⏳ **Time is controlled by you** — not by algorithms, not by feeds — by *you*. Inspired by Solana’s **Proof of History**.
- 🏃‍♂️ **Movement = Journey** — walk, run, or just click — every action becomes a path.
- 🪙 **$EARTH = Participation** — not ownership, not speculation. Earn by being present.
- 🖼️ **NFT = Eternal Trace** — your route, your pause, your voice — stored forever on Arweave.
- 🔐 **Access = Your Choice** — enter via Google (for simplicity) or Phantom (for full anonymity). Equal rights. Zero compromise.

---

## 🕊️ TwinEarth is not a product. It’s a movement.

This is a **sacred digital space** — where:
- Your curiosity becomes an NFT.
- Your voice is archived as part of the planet’s memory.
- Your discovery rewards you with $EARTH.
- Your feedback shapes the code.

> We don’t build according to a rigid plan.  
> We build according to **your presence**.

## 📊 Analytics = Your Voice

We don’t track metrics.  
We listen to **you**.

→ Which locations matter to you?  
→ What kind of NFT artifacts do you want to leave?  
→ What interface feels natural?  
→ Should we add soundscapes? Guided journeys? DAO voting?

**Your answer doesn’t go to a dashboard — it goes into the code.**

> 
> You don’t consume it.  
> You **consecrate** it — with your time, your attention, your silence, your voice.  
> 
> On Solana — where time is provable.  
> Where history is immutable.  
> Where your presence — even anonymous — is eternal.

🌍 **“Join the journey.  
TwinEarth does not wait for owners.  
It waits for those who are ready to be part — with a name, or without.”**
