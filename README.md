## Hi, I'm Vitaly Pozderin— the creator of TwinEarth

"We are not building a metaverse. We're getting the connection back."

I am creating **TwinEarth**— a digital twin of Earth, where:
- Time is controlled by you
- Running = traveling
- NFT = footprint in the planet's memory
- $EARTH = participation, not ownership
* **Currently in development:**
- White Paper v1.0 — done
- MVP "Machu Picchu" - in progress 🚧
- Solana Grant Application - in preparation 📄

# 🌍 TwinEarth Sanctum — Where the Digital Sanctifies the Real. On Solana.

> “You are not a guest here. You are a part of the planet.”

TwinEarth is not a product. It is a **holy space** where:
- Your curiosity becomes an NFT
- Your voice will be remembered by the planet
- Your discovery will bring $EARTH
- Your participation will change the interface

This is a **movement, not a startup**. 
And it is born **with your participation**.

## 🕊️ Sanctum Philosophy

> TwinEarth is a bridge. 
> Between your screen and the real planet. 
> Between your question and the eternal artifact. 
> Between your voice and the voice of the earth. 
> 
> We don't build it according to a plan. 
> We build it according to your feedback.

## 📊 Analytics = Your Voice

We don't collect metrics. 
We collect **your desires**: 
→ Which locations are important? 
→ Which artifacts are needed? 
→ Which interface is convenient? 
→ Which technologies are important? 

** Your answer will become a code.**

3. **In Discord** — discuss philosophy, vote for features
