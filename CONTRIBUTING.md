# 🤝 How to participate in Sanctum TwinEarth

## You are not a user. You are a co-creator.

## How to contribute:

### 1. Suggest a location
> “Add a description of a place that is a ‘holy space’ to you. 
> Where? Why? What do you feel there? 
> The best will be the first in TwinEarth.”

### 2. Describe an artifact
> “What should be at the point? 
> → Voice? 
> → Legend?
> → Question for AI? 
> → History?
> Describe it and I'll add it to the interface.”

###3. Ask a question
> “What do you want to ask the planet?
> → Why was a temple built here? 
> → How did people feel? 
> → How has this place changed the world? 
> The best questions will become artifacts.”

### 4. Become a pilgrim
> Introduce yourself in Discord #pilgrims: 
> → Who are you? 
> → Where are you from? 
> → What are you looking for in TwinEarth? 
> → What is your voice?

This is not a project. 
This is a sanctum. 
And you are its guardians.
